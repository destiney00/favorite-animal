        <h2> About Them </h2>
        <p> The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. <br>
            It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or
            house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family. <br>
            Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely
            and
            avoids human contact.<br>
            Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill vermin. <br>
            About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries. </p>
